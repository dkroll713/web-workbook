    <h3><u><em>*NEW*</em> Update: everything is ok <em>*NEW*</em></u></h3>
    <p>
      Even though I still have no idea how to get all of my work out of the bio branch, without this mistake I wouldn't have realized that
      I know what I'm doing. This "wake-up call" became not a learning experience but proof that I'm retaining this information even better
      than I thought I would.

    <h3><u>Five reasons to check the branch you commit to</u></h3>
    <p>
      One: you will freak out once you see all your work is gone. <br />
      Two: you will wonder how you will redo all the work you lost in a timely fashion. <br />
      Three: you will panic all weekend instead of asking for help. <br />
      Four: you will discover all of your work under a single branch on the day everything is due.
      Five: it sucks, I need to learn github backwards and forwards.

    <h3><u>The time I accidentally overwrote all of my work on github</u></h3>
    <p>
      It's not that interesting, I just worked on all of the current entries and then committed them all to a single branch.
      We have yet to see if I can undo this or if I will even need to.
    </p>

  <div class="entry4">
    <h3><u>I still have no idea how to create a "link"</u></h3>
    <p>
      I can't help but wonder if that was something I missed in the prework, but I went over it pretty thoroughly and didn't see it.
      It must have been in one of the videos or "further learning resources" that I haven't had time to watch yet.
