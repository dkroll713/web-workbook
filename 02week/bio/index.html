  <h4>A little about me</h4>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is David Kroll. I'm currently a student at the University of Oklahoma, and I'm taking classes with the Austin Coding Academy to improve my coding literacy. </p>
<p>
    My goals for this next year include graduating with my degrees in Accounting and Management Information Systems, two closely related areas of study that have a very symbiotic relationship.
  </p>

<h4>Why I started coding</h4>
<p>
  I didn't discover coding until late into my junior year at college. I enjoyed it so much and understood what we did so intuitively that I decided I <i>HAD</i> to include it in my education
  somehow. This began with a minor in MIS that grew to become a major as I became more engrossed. Unfortunately (or fortunately!) I realized that I wasn't learning what I wanted to learn
  in my MIS courses, and decided to pursue further coding education. Since I don't have the time or money needed to pursue a third degree in computer science, I enrolled at the Austin Coding Academy.

  <h4>My coding plans</h4>
  <p>
    If you asked me what I was proficient with, I would say SQL and visual basic. However, these aren't really intensive languages. I'm decent with HTML and CSS as these languages are fairly easy
    to learn, and I can understand what JavaScript does although if you asked me to put something together in JavaScript I would be quite lost. I'm hoping this intro course provides me with the
    necessary expertise to confidently say "yes, I'm good with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and yes I can make a functional website"
  </p>
    <p>
    I love videogames and one day plan to use my exposure to good coding practices here as a first step in videogame development, whether it be professionally or for fun.
